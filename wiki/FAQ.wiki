_Questions & Answers (what you should know)_

*Is etoFork Etomite CMS*

Yes and No! First off, it is built from [http://etomite.com Etomite], a wonderful and great CMS, that I've used for over 5 years now. The main difference is the Manager of etoFork and the additions of features such as Template Variables, Modules and other functions.

*Can I move my Etomite site to etoFork*

Yes, but it would need to be done manually because there are a lot of changes to the database. I'm hoping in time to make an upgrade option in the installer to upgrade from Etomite 1.x to etoFork.

*Is it easy to use*

If you can use Etomite you can use etoFork

*What are Template Variables aka (tvs)*

Template variables are user defined variables for documents. For instance, lets say you want to have a specific chunk of text on a document, but each document will have different text, now you just create a text template variable assign it to your template and now every document that uses that template will have a new text box for entering the text, and you call it in your template just like you call other document variables so just like you would use *[`*pagetitle*`]* you would use *[`*tvname*`]*. Currently there are: Text, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Radio button, and File, and the output types are: Text, Image, Link and Date (all these options are not fully functional yet)

#summary Install on an Etomie v1.x install

=Upgrade from Etomite v1.x=

 # rename your manager folder, example: manager_old
 # copy all files from the etoFork package to the server and overwrite files
 # copy your old config.inc.php file to manager/includes folder
 # set config.inc.php to writeable 777
 # point your browser to youretoinstall.com/install
 # click on Repair Configuration file
 # use phpMyAdmin or another sql manager to import the install/sql/from_1.1sql file

You should now be able to go to the new manager

_*Make sure to check your configuration in the manager and clear the cache*_

_*Also at this time, you must use phpMyAdmin or another sql manager to set your chunks and snippets to the default sections*_

For Snippets set section = 1
For Chunks set section = 2

We will be making it later so that sections are not based on snippets or chunks, they will all be used the same way so that if you make a section called "Menu", you will be able to choose it for snippets and chunks. This will also be added to modules and template variables later on.

#summary Chunks - html code

=Chunks=

Chunks are blocks of HTML. They can only contain HTML. This way you can write whole blocks of HTML code without cluttering up your templates with HTML you'd rather keep separate.

Chunks are also useful for storing HTML that you want to include in a snippet.

Chunks are called in templates and other chunks by using *{{chunk_name}}*

==Creating Chunks==

Chunks are created in the *Manage Resources* area under the chunks tab. Chunks are basic HTML, Javascript or CSS code and it can be mixed. There is a simple syntax highlighter in the editor to help along with your code.

*Example*

{{{
<div class="myNewChunk">Hello All</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    function clickIt() {
        alert('hello everone');
    }
</script>
}}}

Very simple!

==Chunks in Chunks==

You can use chunks inside of other chunks just call it the same way as you would in a template.

*Example*

{{{
<div>
    <p>Below me is another chunk</p>
    *{{another_chunk}}*
</div>
}}}

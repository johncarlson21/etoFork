#summary etoFork - General Info

=etoFork=
----

*etoFork* is a fork of [http://www.etomite.com Etomite] CMS v 1.x. There is a lot of Etomite code that is original, and a lot that I've changed. The manager has been re-built to remove frames and allow new functionality.

Thanks to Ralph over at Etomite for helping out with some of the code and ideas.

Modules, Template Variables and document attributes have been added. Versions of documents is also another highlight as well as Zend Framework style urls

All though it is functional at the moment, there is no release as of yet and some functionality is not finished

Current Code should not be used in a production environment.

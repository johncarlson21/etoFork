=Development=
----

*etoFork* can be used to make a simple static site with just basic HTML, Javascript and CSS, but what if you need something special. Maybe you need to be able to put a menu on a specific page, or you want a different template for a specific page.

This is where Templates, Snippets, Chunks Template Variables (tvs) and Modules come in handy.

==[Templates Templates]==

Templates can be a combination of HTML elements (html, js, css) for your site, but can be used for multiple documents. 

==[Snippets Snippets]==

Snippets are PHP code for your site, to create dynamic content

==[Chunks Chunks}==

Chunks are HTML content that can be re-used through out your site and within snippets

==[TemplateVariables Template Variables]==

TVs are extra attributes for your document, that are attached to specific templates

==[Modules M0odules]==

Modules are PHP code packages that are stored in the file system rather than creating them in the manager.

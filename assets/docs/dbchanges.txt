Please run the installer and select "Upgrade an existing installation" for more information. You will find a link to a database upgrade script there which will automatically make the required changes. No manual changes should be required. If you are logged into the Etomite manager when performing the upgrade you will be required to logout and back in before the manager will work properly due the new permissions settings.
